# CompressedEwkSummary

A few commands to produce a summary plot. One time set up:
```
git clone git clone https://github.com/sbein/CompressedEwkSummary.git
export SCRAM_ARCH=el9_amd64_gcc12
cmsrel CMSSW_15_0_0_pre3
```

Once for each session:
```
cd CMSSW_15_0_0_pre3/src
cmsenv
cd ../../CompressedEwkSummary
```
